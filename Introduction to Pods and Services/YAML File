Pods
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers with shared resources like storage and network.

- **Lifecycle**:
  - Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → Terminated

- **Use Cases**:
  - Running a single application container.
  - Running multiple containers that share resources and are tightly coupled (e.g., sidecar patterns).

Services
Services provide stable networking and expose Pods to other applications or external traffic.

- **Types of Services**:
  1. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service within the cluster.
  2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port.
  3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service to the internet using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

| Service Type     | Accessible From         | Typical Use Case                                | Example Access URL            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **ClusterIP**    | Inside cluster only     | Microservice-to-microservice communication      | `http://backend-service:8080` |
| **NodePort**     | External (via node IP)  | Testing or small setups without a load balancer | `http://<node-ip>:30080`      |
| **LoadBalancer** | Internet (via cloud LB) | Production applications accessible publicly     | `http://<public-ip>`          |
