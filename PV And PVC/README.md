# Kuberneties Persistent Volume(PV) And Persistent Volume Claim(PVC)
---
## Introduction
### Persistent Volume (PV)
A **Persistent Volume** is a storage resource in a Kubernetes cluster that provides persistent storage, independent of Pod lifecycles. It is defined and managed by the cluster administrator.

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
A **Persistent Volume Claim** is a request for storage by a user. Pods use PVCs to access PVs.

### Dynamic Provisioning
Dynamic provisioning automatically creates PVs based on a PVC when a StorageClass is specified. This is particularly useful for cloud-based storage systems like AWS EBS.
