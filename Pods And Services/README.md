# Kubernetes Pods and Services
---
 - ## Introduction to Pods and Services
### Pods
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers with shared resources like storage and network.

- **Lifecycle**:
  - Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed → Terminated

- **Use Cases**:
  - Running a single application container.
  - Running multiple containers that share resources and are tightly coupled (e.g., sidecar patterns).

### Services
Services provide stable networking and expose Pods to other applications or external traffic.

- **Types of Services**:
  1. **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service within the cluster.
  2. **NodePort**: Exposes the service on each node’s IP at a static port.
  3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service to the internet using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

| Service Type     | Accessible From         | Typical Use Case                                | Example Access URL            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **ClusterIP**    | Inside cluster only     | Microservice-to-microservice communication      | `http://backend-service:8080` |
| **NodePort**     | External (via node IP)  | Testing or small setups without a load balancer | `http://<node-ip>:30080`      |
| **LoadBalancer** | Internet (via cloud LB) | Production applications accessible publicly     | `http://<public-ip>`          |

#### ClusterIP (Internal Access Only)
#### NodePort (Access from Browser using Node IP)
#### LoadBalancer (Public IP – Cloud Only)

## Kubernetes Networking: Intra-Pod and Inter-Pod Communication

Kubernetes networking is fundamental for ensuring smooth communication between various components, including pods, services, and external clients. It provides flexible networking configurations for intra-pod and inter-pod communication.

### Intra-Pod Communication
- **Definition**: Intra-pod communication refers to the communication between containers within the same pod.
- **Mechanism**: Containers in a pod share the same network namespace, which means they:
  - Share the same IP address.
  - Can communicate directly using `localhost` and exposed container ports.

### Inter-Pod Communication
- **Definition**: Inter-pod communication refers to the communication between pods.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Kubernetes assigns each pod a unique IP address.
  - Pods communicate directly using these IP addresses or via Kubernetes services.
  - Kubernetes ensures a flat network model where all pods can communicate without NAT.

## Introduction to YAML Scripts and Kubernetes Manifest Files

## Understanding YAML Scripts
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format used extensively in Kubernetes for writing manifest files. It is used to define resources like Pods, Services, Deployments, and more.

### Key Features of YAML
- **Readable**: YAML is simple and easy to understand.
- **Indentation-Based**: Proper indentation is crucial.
- **Data Types**: Supports scalars (strings, numbers), lists, and dictionaries.

### Example YAML Structure
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Writing Manifest Files for Pods and Services
Kubernetes uses manifest files to describe the desired state of resources in the cluster. These files are written in YAML.

### Pod Manifest File
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
**Explanation**:
- `apiVersion`: The API version used (e.g., v1).
- `kind`: The type of resource (e.g., Pod).
- `metadata`: Metadata such as the name and labels.
- `spec`: Specification of the Pod, including containers and their properties.

### Service Manifest File
Services expose Pods to the network and enable communication between them.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-cl-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```
**Explanation**:
- `selector`: Matches the labels of the Pods to be exposed.
- `ports`: Defines the service port and the target port on the Pod.
- `type`: Specifies the service type (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort)

### Kubernetes Service Types for Networking

#### 1. **ClusterIP**
- Default service type.
- Exposes the service only within the cluster.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-clip-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

#### 2. **NodePort**
- Exposes the service on a static port on each node.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-np-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 31195
```

#### 3. **LoadBalancer**
- Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.
- Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-lb-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```
